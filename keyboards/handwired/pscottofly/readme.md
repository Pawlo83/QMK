**PScottoFly** represents my first custom keyboard build, serving as the comprehensive learning platform where I mastered the fundamentals of handwiring and firmware engineering. Based on the open-source ScottoFly design by [Joe Scotto](https://github.com/joe-scotto), this ergonomic split keyboard features a compact 36-key layout optimized through extensive use of QMK’s Mod-Tap and Layer-Tap functions. A key addition is the dedicated gaming layer, which standardizes the left-hand cluster to restore traditional WASD and modifier positions, resolving common compatibility issues inherent to split ergonomic layouts. Case files for the build are available [here](https://github.com/joe-scotto/scottokeebs/tree/main/ScottoFly).
