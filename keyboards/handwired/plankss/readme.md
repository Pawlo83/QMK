**PlankSS** is a handwired 60-key ortholinear keyboard designed to use a Pro Micro controller. It features dual firmware support, compatible with both standard QMK and the Vial GUI for real-time configuration. A nice feature of this build is its system integration, utilizing a custom macro that interfaces with NirCmd to instantly switch Windows audio output devices directly from the keyboard layers. The 3D-printed case was designed with tight tolerances around the USB port, this may require minor sanding depending on the specific dimensions of your microcontrollers port. The design is inspired by the open-source designs of ![Joe Scotto](https://github.com/joe-scotto/).
